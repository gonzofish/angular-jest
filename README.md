# Angular + Jest

This code is for a [Semphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/) article on
developing Angular applications while using
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing.

## Setup / Installation

To get started, run either:

```shell
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

## Tags

This repository has several tags attached to it which act as markers for
notable steps in the creation of the project. These points all have a
leading number to help identify the order of the tags.

For instance, the first tag is `01-install` and represents the completed
list of packages needed for the project. To check it out, run:

```shell
git checkout 01-install
```
